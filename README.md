# Tableau
Tableau to connect data source :open_file_folder:, analyze metadata :clipboard:, build visualisation :bar_chart: and dashboard reporting :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

In this project, I use data downloaded from Tableau_eLearning platform for the "Global Library Data". I use both Tableau Desktop and Tableau online to analyze the data, build dashboard/story, share/comment the dashboard. The Tableau workbook "Global Library Data Dashboard.twbx" is attached. The "raw_data"  folder contains the Microsoft Excel worksheet.

The end user can open the ".twbx" file using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Online to interactively view the dashboard, and find information of interest. For example, we can click on the "Europe" bar from the top chart to only select European library data, where the below chart also reflect to this selection as it is filtered by the top chart. We can then sort the bottom chart by, for example, the "Expenditure" so that we know the United Kingdom tops the list by spending more than USD$4.5 billion on libraries, followed by Germany and France each spends USD$2.7 billion and USD$1.8 billion on libraries.

We sort the bottom chart by the "Total Users" and find Russia has the most library users (60 million) in Europe followed by UK and Italy. This is an interesting finding as Russia is not even one of the top "Expenditure" countries in Europe.

We sort the bottom chart by the "Total Volumes" and find Germany tops the list with more than 3.7 billion volumes of books in its libraries. That's a massive number of books!

What can we understand from the library data so far?\
The top library spending countries in Europe are possibly a reflection of the current economic status in Europe. It may also show the cost of running a library for each country. For example, the United Kingdom spends 60% more on expenditure than Germany by running 30% less libraries. Does that mean the library expenditure in UK is less efficiently used that its counterpart? Not necessarily true. The "Total Users" of UK libraries are more than three times that of Germany, giving the actual expenditure per user in UK less than that in Germany. We look further at the "Total Volumes" of UK and Germany and notice Germany has almost ten times total volumes compared to its counterpart, despite its less expenditure than UK's. This is interesting. It probably shows the library maintaining c
