# Tableau
Tableau to connect data source :open_file_folder:, analyze metadata :clipboard:, build visualisation :bar_chart: and dashboard reporting :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

In this project, I use data downloaded from Tableau_eLearning platform for the "Global Library Data". I use both Tableau Desktop and Tableau online to analyze the data, build dashboard/story, share/comment the dashboard. The Tableau workbook "Global Library Data Dashboard.twbx" is supplied and can be viewed/interactive edited. The "raw_data" contains the Microsoft Excel worksheet.
