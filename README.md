# Tableau
Tableau to connect data source :open_file_folder:, analyze metadata :clipboard:, build visualisation :bar_chart: and dashboard reporting :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

In this project, I use data downloaded from Tableau_eLearning platform for the "Global Library Data". I use both Tableau Desktop and Tableau online to analyze the data, build dashboard/story, share/comment the dashboard. The Tableau workbook "Global Library Data Dashboard.twbx" is attached. The "raw_data"  folder contains the Microsoft Excel worksheet.

The end user can open the ".twbx" file using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Online to interactively view the dashboard, and find information of interest. For example, we can click on the "Europe" bar from the top chart to only select European library data, where the below chart also reflect to this selection as it is filtered by the top chart. We can then sort the bottom chart by, for example, the "Expenditure" so that we know the United Kingdom tops the list by spending more than USD$4.5 billion on libraries, followed by Germany and France each spends USD$2.7 billion and USD$1.8 billion on libraries.

We sort the bottom chart by the "Total Users" and find Russia has the most library users (60 million) in Europe followed by UK and Italy. This is an interesting finding as Russia is not even one of the top "Expenditure" countries in Europe.

We sort the bottom chart by the "Total Volumes" and find Germany tops the list with more than 3.7 billion volumes of books in its libraries. That's a massive number of books!

What can we understand from the library data so far?

The top library spending countries in Europe are possibly a reflection of the current economic status in Europe. It may also show the cost of running a library for each country. For example, the United Kingdom spends 60% more on expenditure than Germany by running 30% less libraries. Does that mean the library expenditure in UK is less efficiently used that its counterpart? Not necessarily true. The "Total Users" of UK libraries are more than three times that of Germany, giving the actual expenditure per user in UK less than that in Germany. We look further at the "Total Volumes" of UK and Germany and notice Germany has almost ten times total volumes compared to its counterpart, despite its less expenditure than UK's. This is interesting. It probably shows the library expenditure mainly contributes to serving library users, rather than storaging the volumes. Fair enough!

Russian libraries stores the second largest volume of books (1.9 billion) in Europe and serves the largest library users (60 billion!) in Europe, using a total expenditure of USD$53 million. This is a reflection of the economic status in the country, such as the manpower cost to operate and maintain libaries.

What if we include library data from all countries?

We de-select the previously used filter so all country data are included.
Sort the bottom chart by "Expenditure". Wow! The United States spends more the USD$21 billion to run its 101,349 libaries. That's five times of $$$ spends by the UK.

Sort the bottom chart by "Total Libraries". India tops the list by having 337,020 libaries countrywide, followed by Indonesia (122,906), Russia (113,867), China (109,673) and the US (101,349). This is reasonable as all countries have a population of over 200 million.

Sort the bottom chart by "Total Users". Wow! South Korea tops the list with more than 438 million library users, almost double the number of library users of the runner up, the United States. Moreover, South Korea spends less than 5% of US expenditures with a budget of USD$1.2 billion. This is an impressive achievement.

Sort the botom chart by "Total Volumes". Germany still tops the rank and must have made great efforts to preserve and archive books. United States comes the second, followed by Russia, Japan and China. Each of the top five countries has more than 1 billion total volume of books.

Knowledge is priceless. Running a library has a price tag. The library expenditure may reflect the economic status of countries, it does not necessarily reflect the usage of librairies and it is not a reflection of knowledge gained in population.
